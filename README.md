```

Or:

```
npm install
```

Setup database with:

### Github Actions

To make sure the linters' checks using Github Actions work properly, you should follow the next steps:

1. On your recently forked repo, enable the GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.

### Usage

Start server with:

```
    rails server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

**Note:** Sign in via Facebook may not work on your local machine because you don't have the access to the APP_ID and APP_SECRET.

### Run tests

```
    rpsec --format documentation
```

> Tests will be added by Microverse students. There are no tests for initial features in order to make sure that students write all tests from scratch.
